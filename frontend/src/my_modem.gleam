//// Modem is a little library for Lustre that helps you manage navigation and URLs
//// in the browser. It converts url requests into messages that you can handle
//// in your app's update function. Modem isn't a router, but it can help you
//// build one!

// IMPORTS ---------------------------------------------------------------------

import gleam/uri.{type Uri}
import lustre/effect.{type Effect}

// TYPES -----------------------------------------------------------------------

pub type Options {
  Options(
    /// Enable this option if you'd like to trigger your url change handler when
    /// a link to the same domain is clicked. When enabled, internal links will
    /// _always_ update the url shown in the browser's address bar but they _won't_
    /// trigger a page load.
    ///
    handle_internal_links: Bool,
    /// Enable this option if you'd like to trigger your url change handler even
    /// when the link is to some external domain. You might want to do this for
    /// example to save some state in your app before the user navigates away.
    ///
    /// You will need to manually call [`load`](#load) to actually navigate to
    /// the external link!
